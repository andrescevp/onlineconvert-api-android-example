# Android APP - Online Convert Sample

This is a pretty simple sample.

Get the information relative to Audio conversions using [Online Conver Java SDK](https://github.com/onlineconvert/onlineconvert-api-sdk-java).

You can found the compiled version in _releases_ folder.

Please use the [Shaded version](https://github.com/onlineconvert/onlineconvert-api-sdk-java/blob/master/releases/oc-java-sdk-1.0.0-shaded.jar?raw=true) that contains all the dependencies.

You can use the normal version, but then probably you will need add dependencies manually.

If you find any errors in the SDK, please report them to us ([time2help@online-convert.com](mailto:time2help@online-convert.com)).
